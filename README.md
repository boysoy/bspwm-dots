# bspwm-dots

My collection of various scripts and config files for bspwm, polybar and other stuff.

# Stuff you need for most of these to work
* wpgtk or pywal (coloscheme generator from wallpaper)
* Polybar (bar)
* Rofi (application launcher, can do other things. You can use dmenu if you like it better)
* rxvt-unicode (terminal, fast and pretty customizable)
* oomox and oomox-autotheme, accyl icons (you can create gtk themes from your wallpaper using pywal/wpgtk)
* compton (shading, reduces screen tearing)
* shell of your choice, I am using zsh. because it has very nice autocompletion

# Distro and wm/de
Any distro really would work. I use ubuntu because it just worksâ„¢

For wm I would recomend bspwm, dwm, or i3(gaps). I guess any tiling wm would work.
If you want de, kde and xfce would work good, if you replace the wm.

If you go with bspwm, you also will need sxhkd, as bspwm doesnt handle keybindings.

# How to set up

Install programms that I have listed

Copy files in config to /pathto/yourhome/.config

Copy files in bin to your bin path

Copy contents of xresources to your .Xresources, and also from zshrc to your, if you use zsh.
